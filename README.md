# DLND_ImageRecognition
Image Classification
In this project, images from the CIFAR-10 dataset are classified. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats,
and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples.
The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. We will build a convolutional, max pooling,
dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we'll get to see the neural network's predictions on the sample images.

This project has been part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree on Udacity.
